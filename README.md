## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot doing this challenge most especially using css for designs. I learned how the box models(paddings, margins and borders) really works, although i had trouble understanding how to use the flexbox in making some designs, I will master it soon. The media query for mobile width and height was fascinating. I'm glad i went through this challenge and looking forward to more.

### Continued development
Like I said earlier i will practice more on flexbox to increase my css skills.

### Useful resources

- (https://wwww.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for responsive web design using media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is an amazing documentation which helped me finally understand CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
